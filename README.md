# zendesk-coding-challenge
This is my submission for the 2021 Zendesk Coding Challenge. I chose to use Node.js to further challenge my self because it's not something that i'm very familiar with. Overall I had a lot of fun and learnt a lot through this experience!

# About Zendesk and what this project does
Zendesk is a company that focused on customer service. From my understanding, if you have a domain with zendesk, customers can submit tickets with issues that they may be facing. That's where their API comes in. I got my own domain and populated it with dummy tickets. Then, I use their API to fetch those tickets and allow users to interact with them.

# Task
For this program, I need to be get familiar with the Zendesk API. The requirements are pretty straight forward:
- Connect to the Zendesk API
- Request all the tickets for your account
- Display them in a list
- Display individual ticket details
- Page through tickets when more than 25 are returned
- Write tests that cover my code

# What software versions I used
 - Node.js version 16.x or later
 - NPM version 8.x or later

# How to run
```
  npm install
```
