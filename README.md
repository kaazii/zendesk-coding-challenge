# zendesk-coding-challenge
This is my submission for the 2021 Zendesk Coding Challenge. I chose to use Node.js to further challenge my self because it's not something that i'm very familiar with. Overall I had a lot of fun and learnt a lot through this experience!

# Task
For this program, I need to be get familiar with the Zendesk API. The requirements are pretty straight forward:
- Connect to the Zendesk API
- Request all the tickets for your account
- Display them in a list
- Display individual ticket details
- Page through tickets when more than 25 are returned
- Write tests that cover my code
